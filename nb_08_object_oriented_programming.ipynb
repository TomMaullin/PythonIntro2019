    "Indeed, if you talk to a computer scientist, there is a good chance they may tell you that OOP is an extremely important and central part of modern day coding. This is certainly how it was taught to me when I took my first course on OOP in Java back in 2014. And, especially when I first started working on imaging data, it felt like a common view among my computer-science oriented colleagues. In fact, many may even tell you today that OOP is the \"gold-standard\" practice for organizing code.\n",

For example, we are all grateful that someone has gone to extreme lengths to create the `np.array` class so that we don't have to. And I hope that some of the examples given in this document and the exercises may have convinced you that classes are certainly useful for some applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in recent years OOP has come under fire in recent years for essentially **over-complicating** simple tasks. Personally, I believe in many cases there is a lot of truth to this. In my experience, when people first learn OOP there is often an extreme temptation to suddenly start wrapping everything up in classes and object definitions. I don't believe this practice is efficient, and I am not alone in this."

Maintaining classes is a lot of work and, in practice, using OOP often results in having to keep track of lots of unnecessary additional pieces of code. \n",
