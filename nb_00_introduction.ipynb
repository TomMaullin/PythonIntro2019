    "In the `PythonIntro2019` folder you will find this and 5 other notebooks, each of which consists of introductions to and descriptions of the different lanuguage features of python, as well as practical advice for avoiding common mistakes often made by new users. Roughly speaking, as the section numbers increase the difficulty will increase so there should be something for users of all ability. Some subsections are marked as **Important**; we recommend you make sure you visit these!"
